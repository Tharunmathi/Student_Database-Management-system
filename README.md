# Student_Database-Management-system 
                              A student database management system (DBMS) is a software application that is used to store, manage, and retrieve data related to students and their academic records. It typically includes features such as:
student registration
enrollment management
grade tracking
transcript generation
class scheduling
assignments and grade management
student and faculty portals
                                The student DBMS is typically used by schools, colleges, and universities to keep track of student information, as well as by administrators and instructors to manage class schedules, assignments, and grades. Some systems also provide students with online access to their own records and grades, allowing them to check their progress and performance in real-time. Data can be stored in a centralized database, allowing for easy access and management by the authorized personnel. Some examples of student DBMS systems are CampusVue, Jenzabar, and Colleague.
